# MicroPython Computational Chemistry and Physics Calculator

A comprehensive suite of computational tools for chemistry and physics calculations, optimized for graphing calculators including TI-84 Plus CE Python, NumWorks, and Casio Graph 90+E.

## Features

### Chemistry Calculations
- **Molecular weight calculations** from chemical formulas
- **Ideal Gas Law** solver (PV = nRT)
- **pH and pOH calculations** from concentrations
- **Concentration and dilution** calculations (C₁V₁ = C₂V₂)
- **Rate law calculations** and kinetics
- **Quantum energy levels** (particle in box, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom)
- **Thermochemical calculations**

### Physics Calculations
- **Kinematics** (constant acceleration, projectile motion)
- **Force and motion** (Newton's laws, friction, centripetal force)
- **Energy and work** (kinetic, potential, work-energy theorem)
- **Thermodynamics** (heat transfer, thermal expansion)
- **Waves and oscillations** (wave properties, SHM, pendulum)
- **Electromagnetism** (Coulomb's law, electric fields, Ohm's law, magnetic forces)

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Memory optimized** for calculator hardware constraints
- **Modular design** for easy deployment
- **Simple interface** suitable for calculator screens
- **No external dependencies** beyond built-in math module
